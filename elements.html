										<h2 id="content">The City</h2>
										<p>Banglore is situated in south easten Karnataka so it is very close to both the borders of Andhra Pradesh as well as Tamilnadu. The name Bangalore comes from an ancient name called Bendakaluru meaning a town but Bangalore is called Bengaluru itself in the 9th century itself which is found by the Babru inscription. And this inscription is really wonderful which also includes data about a battle fought in Bengaluru in the old times, the inscription also presented the various dresses at that time and their festivals. Karnataka is especially unique in the world itself for its diverse and amazing scale of inscriptions.</p>

												<h3>Physical Features</h3>
												<p>The average elevation of Bangalore is 900m above sea level. Bangalore gets almost 970ml of annual rainfall, which is one of the highest for major cities in India. This rainfall is possible due to a phenomenon called the Palakkad gap. Bangalore is situated in Dharwar craton which is one of the oldest. There is a unique feature in Bangalore which is that the craton or the bedrock of the earth rises above the surface to form mountain ranges or hills, for example: Nandi hills. Savandurga in Bangalore is the largest rock in asia. In historical times, the east coast of India was sticking to Antarctica while the west coast was attached to Africa. The southern parts of India were sticking to Madagascar and when they split there was some kind of fault line or breakage in the Western Ghats, and this is called the Palakkad gap. This gap allows the rain clouds to break through the hill range of Western Ghats and precipitate in several regions across southern India. The most important feature of Bangalore is the high rainfall and its altitude. The topography of Bangalore is undulating with a central ridge running NNE-SSW. The highest point is Doddabettahalli, which is 962 m (3,156 ft) and lies on this ridge. No major rivers run through the city, though the Arkavathi and [Dakshin Pinakini river] cross paths at the Nandi Hills, 60 km (37 mi.) to the north.</p>

British did the most developments, constructions which took place in Mysore, Bengaluru. Lord Connemara, the governor of Madras (1890) and General Sir Harry Prendergast, a British resident in Mysore, visited the settlement and lent support to the development of Whitefield. Shivajinagar was called as Blackpally. It was named so because Kempe Gowda founded modern Bangalore. The first settlers in the area were farmers from Gingee, who set up a village and cultivated white rice. It is believed that the name Black pally for the area came from the bili akki (white rice) that they grew in their fields.
